🎉 Discount Calculator - Your Shopping Buddy! 🛍️
What’s This? 🤔
Ever wondered if that discount is really worth it? This little Python script is here to help you figure out the final price after a discount—but only if that discount is a sweet 20% or more. Otherwise, it’s business as usual with the original price!

How It Works 🧙‍♂️
The magic happens in the calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) function:

Feed it the original price and discount percentage.

If the discount is 20% or bigger, it poofs! and slashes your price accordingly.

If it’s below 20%, no magic — you pay full price.

Then, you get to be the boss! The script asks you for:

The original price of your treasure 🎁.

The discount percentage you’ve spotted 🏷️.

It quickly tells you if you’re getting a great deal or if it’s better to keep your wallet closed tight!

How to Use It 🚀
Fire up your Python interpreter or run the script.

Type in the original price when asked (make it count!).

Enter the discount percentage you found.

Voilà! Get your final price and see if you just scored a bargain. 🤑

Enter the original price of the item: 80

😕 No discount applied. Price stays at: 80.00
